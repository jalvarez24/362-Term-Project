# CPSC 362 Project - Northeast Airlines (Summer 2018)
The purpose of this class is more geared towards teaching us about the foundations of software design and focus less about the actual code as competent programmers. Our system was written completely in C++ as it was what our whole group was familiar with and uses no back-end as of now.
